## üìä Spread Analysis

The scraper now calculates the **spread percentage** for each product, which represents the dealer's markup between buy and sell prices. This helps identify:

- **Investment efficiency**: Lower spreads mean better value for investors
- **Product categories**: Gold bars typically have lower spreads than coins
- **Size premium**: Larger bars generally offer better spreads
- **Collectible premium**: Numismatic items have higher spreads due to collector value

### Spread Formula
```
Spread % = ((Sell Price - Buy Price) / Sell Price) √ó 100
```

### Typical Spread Ranges (to end of 2025)
- **Large investment bars** (50g+): 0.5% - 1.5%
- **1oz investment bars/coins**: 0.5% - 2%
- **Smaller bars/coins**: 1% - 5%
- **Collectible/numismatic items**: 5% - 30%
