## üìä Spread Analysis

The scraper now calculates the **spread percentage** for each product, which represents the dealer's markup between buy and sell prices. This helps identify:

- **Investment efficiency**: Lower spreads mean better value for investors
- **Product categories**: Gold and silver bars typically have lower spreads than coins
- **Size premium**: Larger bars generally offer better spreads
- **Collectible premium**: Numismatic items have higher spreads due to collector value

### Spread Formula
```
Spread % = ((Sell Price - Buy Price) / Sell Price) √ó 100
```

### Typical Spread Ranges (to end of 2025)
- **Large investment bars** (50g+): 0.5% - 1.5%
- **1oz investment bars/coins**: 0.5% - 2%
- **Smaller bars/coins**: 1% - 5%
- **Collectible/numismatic items**: 5% - 30%

### Dealer Comparison
With the `--compare-tavex` flag, the scraper compares spreads between igold.bg and tavex.bg:
- Shows which dealer offers the lower spread for each product
- Calculates the spread difference
- Identifies overall which dealer has better pricing
- Helps find the best value for both buying and selling gold

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Manual Usage

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/peivanov/igold_scraper.git
cd igold_scraper

# 2. Set up a virtual environment (Recommended)
# On Ubuntu / Linux
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv -y

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

üîπ On Windows (PowerShell or CMD)
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# or: venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# If blocked by execution policy, use instead:
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

üëâ If you see an error about execution policies in PowerShell, either run venv\Scripts\activate.bat (CMD-style) or temporarily allow scripts with:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

3. Install dependencies

Once your venv is active, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the scrapers

# Gold scraper
python igold_scraper.py

# Silver scraper
python igold_silver_scraper.py

# To enable Tavex price comparison (gold only):
python igold_scraper.py --compare-tavex

# To add timestamp to the output file:
python igold_scraper.py --add-timestamp
python igold_silver_scraper.py --add-timestamp

# To use both options (gold only):
python igold_scraper.py --compare-tavex --add-timestamp
```

The results will be saved in:

# Gold results
igold_gold_products_sorted.csv
# or when comparing with Tavex:
igold_tavex_gold_products_sorted.csv
# or with timestamp (format: ddmmyyhhmm):
igold_gold_products_sorted_170920252140.csv

# Silver results
igold_silver_products_sorted.csv
# or with timestamp:
igold_silver_products_sorted_170920252140.csv
```
